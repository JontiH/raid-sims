# Anduin Wrynn

Two scripts are provided: a full encounter script accompanied by an appropriate apl and a script for just a single intermission. Focusing on intermission boss damage could be more useful unless you are easily pushing the 10% push mark early during the second intermission. If using the intermission script only, the custom apls should not be used.
