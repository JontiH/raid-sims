# Raid Sims

A collection of custom raid event scripts and apls for raid bosses that warrant specialized optimization effort but can't accurately be simmed with existing fight styles.

Each encounter directory will contain a `encounter.simc` which holds all relevant raid events and option settings to make the sim work. Alongside it are spec specific apls that should be used, these have been optimized to use cooldowns as best as it can assuming the encounter script provided is used.
